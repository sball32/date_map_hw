# Question 1: 
Generate a sequence of dates from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2025, spaced by
every two months. Extract the year, quarter, and ISO week number for each date.
```{r}
#Generate the dates from 2015-01-01 for every 2 months in the future
date_seq <- seq(from = ymd("2015-01-01"), 
                to = ymd("2025-12-31"), 
                by = "2 months")

#Extract the year, quarter, and ISO week number
date_info <- data.frame(
  Date = date_seq,
  Year = year(date_seq),
  Quarter = quarter(date_seq),
  ISO_Week = isoweek(date_seq)
)

#Print to see the correct output
head(date_info, 15) #table is long, so only show 15 outputs
```
